14.4 What is the difference between the different types of joins?
	-- Taken from w3schools.com --
    (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
    LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
    RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
    FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records when there is a match in either left or right table

14.5 What is denormalization?
	The process of optimizing read performance on a database at the cost of write performance. By creating redundant data or grouping it together it can make it fast to access this data especially in very large databases.
