To implement three stacks in one array alocate an array with the combined sizes of all three stacks and alocate head, tail, and current pointer for each stack. In this example, all three stacks would need to be initialized at the same time. There are ways to do this with an infinite number of stacks and alocate them whenever needed but that gets a bit more complicated to explain. Essentially, the array acts the same way the computer's memory does for alocating an array.
