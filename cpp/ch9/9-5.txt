Design a caching system to help avoid using a very costly processSearch() function.


After every search, store the result in the cache. When processSearch() is called, call the cache function first.
The cache function will check if the search already exists and if so, return that result or null.
If the cache function returns null, processSearch() will continue as normal.
Otherwise it will return the result of the cache function.
