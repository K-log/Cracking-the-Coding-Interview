How you you design a system like pastbin where a user enters a piece of text and get a generated link to it.

Create a website that gives users access to a text box. 
Upon submitting their text, the system generates a hash of the text which then becomes part of the URL.
Because users are anonymous, and cannot change text attached to a URL once it is created, duplicate entries would have the same URL.
This would help save on storage space although it would need to be changed if entries were attached to a username or were editable.
