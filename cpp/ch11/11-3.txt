To test a functions that tests whether or not a chess piece can move on a board, I would first check the common case. Given coordinated the exists on the boards and belong to an empty square and a non empty square, the method should return true and false respectively. Next I would test illegal coordinates, negative, out of bounds, duplicate x and y values etc. and confirm that the method returns false.
